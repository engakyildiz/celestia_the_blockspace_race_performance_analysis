# celestia_the_blockspace_race_performance_analysis
Conduct Performance Analysis of Your Node


# In this study, a simple tool was designed with Python Programming language to analyze Celestia the Blockspace Race Light Node Server Performance, System Logs, Network Traffic, Peer Connections, CPU Usage, Memory Usage and Disk Usage.

## Prerequisites

- Python3
- Python3 psutil Library

Make sure you have python3 on your server. To check python3 version, use the following command:

`python3 -V`

`which python3`

If you don't have python, please follow these step:

`sudo apt install python3 python3-pip`

Install the psutil library using pip:

`pip3 install psutil`

Install the tcpdump library:

`sudo apt install tcpdump`

Download Geekbench with Wget by running:

`wget https://cdn.geekbench.com/Geekbench-6.0.0-LinuxARMPreview.tar.gz`

Once it has finished downloading, unpack it with:

`tar xf Geekbench-6.0.0-LinuxARMPreview.tar.gz`

Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/engakyildiz/celestia_the_blockspace_race_performance_analysis.git`

## Install and Usage

Change to the path:

`cd celestia_the_blockspace_race_performance_analysis/`

Run the bellow command:

`python3 celestia_the_blockspace_race_performance_analysis.py`

After running the above command, you can see the analysis of Celestia the Blockspace Race Light Node Server Performance, System Logs, Network Traffic, Peer Connections, CPU Usage, Memory Usage and Disk Usage.
